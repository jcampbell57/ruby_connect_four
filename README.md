## Behind the scenes

### Project notes

- Run `rspec` to run tests
- I think I might have written too many tests. I could see the benefit to having minimal tests that focus on the most important things. 

### Resources

- For board design, I was inspired by [this example](https://replit.com/@thantko20/Connect-Four#main.rb).


## Installation

- Clone this repository to your desktop.
- Navigate to the top level of the directory by running `cd ruby_connect_four`.
